### Event Description

🔒 Dive into the world of Kubernetes authentication with Martin Nirtl at our Meetup this Thursday.

🚀 "Unlocking Kubernetes Authentication with Dex" - In this talk, you'll discover that Kubernetes provides only basic authentication support out of the box. But worry not, as we have Dex, the CNCF project that takes authentication to the next level, offering single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and more.

🌐 Explore the essentials of Kubernetes authentication and get hands-on with Dex through a live demo. Martin will walk you through the pros and cons of various authentication mechanisms for Kubernetes and show you how to implement SSO using Dex.
Don't miss out on this insightful session that goes beyond authentication! See you there!
