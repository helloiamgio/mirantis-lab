### Event Description

Platform engineering: What is it, really, and does it make sense for your company? If so, how do you get started?

In this talk, we’ll provide an introduction to platform engineering—the pros, the cons, and how to know whether it’s a fit for your organization. Then we’ll dig into Backstage, an open source project for building developer portals that originated at Spotify.

Through a live demo, you’ll learn:
• How to create your very own Integrated Developer Portal (IDP) or platform
• Challenges and considerations for implementing a platform project
• How users consume services offered by an IDP built with Backstage
