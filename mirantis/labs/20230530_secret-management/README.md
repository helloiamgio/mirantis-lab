### Event Description
While out-of-the-box Kubernetes provides rudimentary secret management, most teams need more sophisticated functionality like dynamic secrets and secret rotation.

HashiCorpâ€™s (HCP) Vault is a popular open source solution, providing best-in-class secret management capabilities. Better yet, the projectâ€™s new Kubernetes operator integrates Vault smoothly with Kubernetes clusters, so developers can consume secrets more easily. But setting up a production-grade implementation isnâ€™t always easy.

In this Tech Talk, weâ€™ll show you:
- Why Vault is a good choice for cloud-agnostic secrets management
- How to deploy a production-grade setup (from a theoretical standpoint, watch out for another session on HCP Vault where we do this live)
- Tips for establishing secure secrets management workflows
- How to use the new Vault Secrets Operator

## Demo

I kept the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEno2fVuJ8U&t=1309s) and its setup intentionally simple to lower the entry level as much as possible. The demo setup itself was actually a mix of publicly available tutuorials from HashiCorp. If you don't know these tutorials and you appreciate Vault as much as I do, you should definitely [check them out](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes)!

If I could grow some interest and you are now looking for a guided tutorial, I recommend this official HCP tutorial using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/): [Static secrets with the Vault Secrets Operator on Kubernetes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/vault-secrets-operator#the-vault-secrets-operator)

If you are still curious what I did for my demo, I kind of combined the following two:
- Setting up HCP Vault with integrated storage (Raft): https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-minikube-raft
- Setting up Vault Secrets Operator and using static secrets: https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/vault-secrets-operator

> Note: Some of the points in my demo (e.g. Kubernetes auth and secret name/path) are still very different to the tutorials' flows.

Apart from the setup, I have put all the custom resources and the demo app deployment (which is actually busybox doing nothing) with the different secret mount options into the [demo](demo) folder.

## Research
