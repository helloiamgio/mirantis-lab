# Secret Management

Watch the recording: TBD

### Event Description
While out-of-the-box Kubernetes provides rudimentary secret management, most teams need more sophisticated functionality like dynamic secrets and secret rotation.

HashiCorpâ€™s Vault is a popular open source solution, providing best-in-class secret management capabilities. Better yet, the projectâ€™s new Kubernetes operator integrates Vault smoothly with Kubernetes clusters, so developers can consume secrets more easily. But setting up a production-grade implementation isnâ€™t always easy.

In this Tech Talk, weâ€™ll show you:
ðŸ”‘ Why Vault is a good choice for cloud-agnostic secrets management
ðŸ”‘ How to deploy a production-grade setup
ðŸ”‘ Tips for establishing secure secrets management workflows

## Demo

I need to cleanup the demo deployment files first ðŸ™ˆ, before I will upload them here! Expect them till 1st of June, 2023 ðŸ¤ž

## Research

I really recommend to read the must-reads! They are a great resource to understand the bigger problem with Secret Management as a whole, as well as in combination with Kubernetes:
