### Event Description

Out of the box, Kubernetes provides only bare-bones support for authentication. Fortunately, open source projects like Dex can help organizations manage authentication at scale, providing single sign-on (SSO) functionality and much more.

On October 3, Mirantisâ€™ Martin Nirtl will explain the fundamentals of Kubernetes authentication and walk you through how to use Dex with a live demo. Join the Tech Talk to learn:
- The pros and cons of available Kubernetes authentication mechanisms (with a focus on OIDC tokens)
- How to use Dex to implement SSO for Kubernetes
- Authorization challenges and best practices for overcoming them

## Demo

Step-by-step guide is coming on Monday!
