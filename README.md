# Talks, Talks, Talks

Hi there üëã

With my start at [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/), I have started giving public talks üó£Ô∏è on various tech topics. At some point, I thought it would maybe be useful for you to understand what and where  I did my research. Also, I want to share configuration and other stuff that I have created for my demos. Hope you find it useful!! ü§ì
